# Hexapod Simulation

This repository includes the robot's URDF and python code to simulate the gait of the hexapod in a PyBullet environment. 

For a complete overview of the project, refer to the [main Hexapod repository](https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod).

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod-Simulation.git
    ```
2. Create a conda environment:
    ```bash
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate hexapod-sim
    ```

### üöÄ Delpoy

1. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python simulation/simulation.py
   ```

## üìù Notes

This simulation is based on early-stage code and serves as a prototype. A polished version of the same code will be hosted on the [Controller repository](https://github.com/ggldnl/Hexapod-Controller). 

## TODO

- [ ] Add documentation on how to interpret simulation results.
- [ ] Provide a way to select gait strategy from terminal.
- [ ] Provide videos of the simulation.
